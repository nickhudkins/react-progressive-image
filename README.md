React Progressive Image
===

I have never built a module for other people. So, don't use this yet please.

Also, disclaimer: The folks over at Formidable Labs have a thing called the exact same name. They had it first. I am the idiot that didn't do a search. This will be changing names to something like "React (Sorta Like Medium) Image" or something.

Thanks to https://github.com/MatteoGabriele/vue-progressive-image for the inspiration to take this and let other people use it.
